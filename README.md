# MachineLearning
This is a repository to store all code for Practical Applications 1 and 2. 
The files are separated into folders 'Assignment1' (non-probabilistic classifiers) and 'Assignment2' (probabilistic classifiers).

The files called 'BreastCancerWisconsin_XXX.ipynb' contain the trained models, feature subselection and evaluation.
The files called 'XXX_n_features.ipynb' contain tests for the optimal number of chosen features.
